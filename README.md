# Mystrix Pro in Ableton Live 12

## MIDI Remote Scripts and Custom Map for Mystrix Pro for Ableton Live

**Requirments:**

- Mystrix Pro
- Ableton Live 12 ( tested in 12.3 )
- MatrixOS 3.1

**Instructions**

1. Place the folder Mystrix_Pro in your MIDI Remote Scripts folder. In MacOS is:\
```/Applications/[Ableton Live version].app/Contents/App-Resources/MIDI Remote Scripts```\
I am not using a Windows machine so for Windows you have to search the location.

2. Upload the AbletonLive_CustomMap.uada with [editor.203.io ](https://edit.203.io/) to your Mystrix Pro.

3. Check the image bellow for Ableton Live settings\

   Please note: Port 1 is selected and **not** Port 2

You are set!

You can control a 8X4 ( _my preference you can change it but you have to move or delete the other controls as well ... trackstop / trackmute etc_ ) grid in Ableton Live clips. It is highlighted in Ableton Live with a red outline.

The first 4 rows in Mystrix Pro are the 4 rows inside the red outline box in Ableton Live. Please note they **are not** the very first 4 rows in general, since you can move this red box in Ablet Live ( how to do that follows in a bit... ). So Notes 1-32 launch clips inside the red outlined box.

Next row ( yellow Notes 39-46 ) is the **Track Stop** for the respected Track 1 to 8.

Next row ( purple Notes 52-59 ) is the **Track Mute** for the respected Track 1 to 8

Green Notes 33-34-35-36 move the red outlined box in Live. 33 is UP. 34 is DOWN. 35 is LEFT. 36 is RIGHT.

Blue Notes 37-38 move the selected track left and right. 37 is LEFT. 38 is RIGHT.

Blue Note 50 is Master Play

Red Note 51 is Master Stop

Pink Notes 47-48 are Scene movement. 47 is LEFT. 48 is RIGHT.

Blue Note 49 is Play Current Scene.

Thats it! If you need help modifying anything feel free to ask!
